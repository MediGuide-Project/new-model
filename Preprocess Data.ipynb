Appendix cancers are rare but in most cases surgery is enough for complete treatment and recovery.

Wish you good health.', 'Instruction:\\none of my elder sister was suffering from renal cell carcinoma .Four months before doctors completed nephrectomy of her right kidney.A completion of nephrectomy one oncologist completed 20 radiotherapy course. Now it is showing recurrence of carcinoma near the right kidney.At this moment dr. suggest to eat tab-surafenib 400mg twice daily. we are not rely on this doctor.There is any better treatment for her. cancer still not spread another part of the body. Please suggest. Thanks Rabiul Islam.\\n\\nResponse:\\nsince you said your sister has recurrence it is important to confirm whether recurrence is confined to local region only or if there is spread to distant parts of the body. If the recurrence is solitary, resection of the lesion would help. Sorafenib  is for metastatic disease. Since her disease has come back in just 4months, you need to understand that she has got aggressive cancer and whatever treatment is offered the responses are shortlived', 'Instruction:\\nHi doctor, I am 31 years old. I am trying to conceive for two years and did four Comid cycles, ovulation happened but no conception. Then did Letrozole cycle, and got pregnant. But was later diagnosed with molar pregnancy and had D and C. Then took a break for six months, again did two Clomid cycles ovulation happened but no conception. Now did Letrozole cycle but no conception. I do not understand what is the reason for no pregnancy. My husband did his semen analysis it is 42% normal. My hormones tests for FSH, prolactin was normal, and pelvic ultrasounds are normal. Could you please guide me regarding this? I am really upset.\\n\\nResponse:\\nHi. As you have taken many treatments but pregnancy is not happening. Actually I need to see all the investigations before coming to a conclusion. But with your history, I can say that you can do hysterosalpingography, to see the tubes are good or not. If not satisfactory then you may require a laparoscopic-hysteroscopic examination to see the tubal cyst and endometrial lining. There is a history of molar pregnancy, so need to do some more test also. Pregnancy is not a simple process. You can consult infertologist with all the previous reports and can continue the treatment. Many times it takes more time. Because it is very complicated. And the chance of pregnancy is only once in one cycle. Patience and a positive attitude towards treatment are also as important as the treatment itself.', 'Instruction:\\nHi doctor. My GGT reading in my liver function was abou 850; but a CT scan revealed no scar or damage to my liver and every other about the liver appeared normal except that it was mildly enlarged leading to a conclusion of mild hepatomegaly.

I am suffering from pain in my right abdomen (lower side) with constipated motions. This pain also radiates to my right leg and back sometimes (especially while applying pressure to evacuate). I also feel an urge to evacuate after having meals. Frequency is more than thrice a day. I feel less energetic and lethargic. And I also feel frequent urination . Occasionally, feel bloated and acidity. The problems have resurfaced after I underwent an appendicitis surgery in Aug 2012. I took allopathic medicines in 2008 and by taking heavy doses of anti-spasmodics, antidepressants and other medicines over a year, the problems got subsided but the same problems have reoccurred now and posing numerous problems in my personal as well as professional life. I have also undergone alternative therapies ( ayurvedic and herbal treatments) but didn t help much. I have been taking care of my diet as various doctors said IBS is aggravated due to imbalanced and gas-producing foods.... I only get temporary relief and the problems reoccur if I stop medications. I have also felt the problem increases (pain as well as constipation) when i masturbate. Please help me out as it has been a harrowing experience as I have taken so many tests (all are normal), consulting numerous doctors without any effective results and it is really depressing sometimes.\\n\\nResponse:\\nHi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for calling H.C.M.Forum. you have got pain in right lower abdomen , some times spreading to back and leg when straining for defaecation. You feel an urge to evacuate, after food, You feel less energetic, and lethergic. You also feel bloating and acidic. Pain recurred after a surgery for appendicitis. You have got frequency of micturition. and pain increasing after masturbation. No relief with many treatments, and many systems of medicines. I advise you to consult an urologist for diagnosis and treatment. Have the urinary system examined for prostate, urinary tract infection, or stones in the urinary tract, which would have co existed along with I.B.S. Avoid taking spices, junk foods, and oily foods. Avoid untimely diet. Practice diversion procedures like yoga, meditation, reading books like magazines, and hearing interested music. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

Stage 4 ovarian cancer is not curable. Ovarian cancer is a dangerous cancer because it is asymptomatic and is often not diagnosed until it is in its advanced stages. Between 2000 and 2010, the rates of diagnosis of ovarian cancer have remained relatively stable, with a decrease of less than 1 percent annually in the number of women diagnosed. The mortality rate and life expectancies have remained stable.For stage IV ovarian cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 17.5%.

At the age of 24, I was diagnosed with a heart condition. I was told I had heart disease that was similar to an 80 year old. I also had diabetes. I had just left the Marine Corps Reserve a year earlier. I joined the Marines at age of 17. I received a number of vaccinations in boot camp, one of which was the smallpox vaccine. When I left boot camp for R and R, I went home where joined in a game of pick up football. I began to have tightness in my chest and I was short of breath. I used to believe my problem developed from some sort of virus I got from the air-jet vaccination gun the service used, but now after speaking to one doctor by chance. Now I believe my problems were from the smallpox vaccination. I have been fighting an up hill battle with the Veterans Administration on compensation and treatment for the past 30 plus years, because of the lack of help from the medical field. I need to fine evidence and were to fined it. Who know more about what adverse effects smallpox vaccines cause and who can help me with my case. Thank you, Michael Morin\\n\\nResponse:\\nHi, Yes, research studies do show that few people do get heart problems after taking small pox vaccination. Few deaths have also been reported. Presently if you have tightness in the chest associated with breathlessness it could be angina. As such angina is not a disease but is caused by low oxygen in the blood reaching the heart. However, angina can be indicative of some serious developing coronary artery disease. You can take sublingual Nitrogycerine when you feel tightness in the chest after consultation with your treating doctor. Do not neglect yourself, visit a cardiologist, get physically examined & get all screening tests done to rule out any CAD. The tests will include CBC, Urinalysis, lipid function tests, X-ray, ECG, Echocardiography, Stress tests & CT or MRI if required. Get treated. In the meantime, stop addictions if any, avoid taking red meat, oily-spicy food. Take low carbohydrate, boiled home made food, fruits & veggies. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This cant be tumour relaps because this is lesion in abdominall wall,obviously some local infection or wound abscess.This is often seen after laparotomy. Appendix cancers are rare but in most cases surgery is enough for complete treatment and recovery. If tehre were no found metastasis or extended disease during the surgery, you dont have to expect relaps. If they found it they would recomend chemotherapy. This lesion around belly can be treated with antibiotic creams or by surgical drainage. Wish you good health.\n"

However, there are no published reports to suggest that triage tags have improved the management of incidents involving more than 24 persons, and a number of reports have detailed problems associated with triage tag use. Alternative systems of scene management such as geographical triage have been successfully used in very large incidents, and are recommended as an alternative to triage tags. Documentation cards attached to casualties may be of use in situations where casualties will pass through an extended evacuation chain, and clear labels for deceased casualties are of benefit as they discourage repeat assessments. Adoption of an evidence-based approach to multiple casualty incident scene management will require a paradigm shift in the thinking of ambulance services. A broad-based educational approach that encourages critical reappraisal of existing procedures is recommended.',\n",

              "  'Clinical investigators have long theorized about the role of reward processing and positive affect in depression. One theory posits that compared to nonmelancholic depressives, melancholic depressives experience less consummatory (i.e., post-reward), but comparably low anticipatory (prior to reward), positive affect. We tested whether frontal EEG asymmetry, a putative marker of the anticipatory reward system, is present only before an individual receives a reward or also after receiving a reward (i.e., during consummatory reward processing). We also examined whether melancholic depression, a condition characterized by a deficit in consummatory reward processing, is associated with abnormal EEG asymmetries in alpha band power. Effects in other frequency bands (delta, theta, or beta) were also explored. EEG was recorded in 34 controls, 48 nonmelancholic depressives, and 17 melancholic depressives during a slot machine task designed to elicit anticipatory and consummatory reward processing. Results indicated that, for alpha, the frontal EEG asymmetry of greater relative left activity was specific to anticipatory reward processing. During the consummatory phase, individuals with melancholic depression exhibited different posterior EEG asymmetries than individuals with nonmelancholic depression (and controls at a trend level). This second finding was largely due to melancholics exhibiting relatively lower right posterior activity and nonmelancholics exhibiting relatively lower left activity. These results suggest that a posterior asymmetry may be a marker for melancholic depression and aberrant consummatory reward processing.',\n",

We evaluate the efficacy of soaking mesh in antibiotics to prevent prosthetic infection in an animal model of clean-contaminated ventral hernia repair (VHR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats underwent an acute VHR with one of four synthetic meshes (composite multifilament polyester (Parietex PCO), multifilament polyester (Parietex TET), composite monofilament polypropylene (Ventralight), or monofilament polypropylene (SoftMesh)). Prior to implantation, mesh was soaked in saline or 10 mg/ml of vancomycin for 15 min. Following implantation, meshes were contaminated with 10(4) CFU of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. Thirty days after implantation, mesh samples were cultured and evaluated under scanning electron microscope for biofilm formation. RESULTS: Presoaking meshes significantly improves bacterial clearance in composite meshes and multifilament polyester mesh. MRSA clearance was as follows for all meshes (saline-soaked vs. vanco-soaked): Parietex PCO (0 vs. 56 %, p = 0.006), Parietex TET (0 vs. 50 %, p = 0.01), Ventralight (20 vs. 78 %, p = 0.012), and SoftMesh (70 vs. 80 %, p = 0.6). MRSA biofilm formation was consistent with bacterial growth. CONCLUSION: Presoaking multifilament and composite mesh in vancomycin solution reduces MRSA bacterial growth. Its implementation may reduce the risk of mesh infection in clean-contaminated cases, although further investigation with human trials should be performed.',\n",

In Germany, recent legislation confirms that advance directives (AD) have to be followed if they apply to the medical situation, but implementation of ACP has not yet been described. METHODS/DESIGN: In a longitudinal controlled study, we compare 1 intervention region (4 nursing homes [n/hs], altogether 421 residents) with 2 control regions (10 n/hs, altogether 985 residents). Inclusion went from 01.02.09 to 30.06.09, observation lasted until 30.06.10. Primary endpoint is the prevalence of ADs at follow-up, 17 (12) months after the first (last) possible inclusion. Secondary endpoints compare relevance and validity of ADs, process quality, the rate of life-sustaining interventions and, in deceased residents, location of death and intensity of treatment before death. The regional multifaceted intervention on the basis of the US program Respecting Choices(R) comprises training of n/h staff as facilitators, training of General Practitioners, education of hospital and ambulance staff, and development of eligible tools, including Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment in case of Emergency (POLST-E). Participation data: Of 1406 residents reported to live in the 14 n/hs plus an estimated turnover of 176 residents until the last possible inclusion date, 645 (41%) were willing to participate. Response rates were 38% in the intervention region and 42% in the control region. Non-responder analysis shows an equal distribution of sex and age but a bias towards dependency on nursing care in the responder group. Outcome analysis of this study will become available in the course of 2011. DISCUSSION: Implementing an ACP program for the n/hs and related health care providers of a region requires a complex community intervention with the effect of nothing less than a cultural shift in this health care sector. This study is to our knowledge the first to develop a strategy for regional implementation of ACP, and to evaluate its feasibility in a controlled design.',\n",

              "  \"BACKGROUND: Infliximab has recently emerged as an efficacious agent for patients with severe Crohn's disease. There are only few studies on the use of infliximab in children with Crohn's disease: most of them are retrospective and deal only with the clinical response to the drug. AIM: We aimed at assessing the efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents with severe Crohn's disease recruited consecutively and followed up prospectively at a single centre. Clinical response, intestinal inflammation and growth pattern were evaluated. PATIENTS: Eighteen patients entered into the trial (median age: 13 years, range: 6-18). They were referred because of severe symptoms with unsatisfactory response to conventional drugs. METHODS: All patients received a baseline schedule of three intravenous infusions of infliximab (0, 2 and 6 weeks), 5 mg/kg. Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, nutritional and activity serum variables, and ileocolonoscopy (with histology) were evaluated before and 8 weeks after beginning the therapy. All patients had long-term administration of azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day). After the baseline schedule, eight patients had a retreatment infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg) every 8 weeks. Weight and height Z scores were measured before starting the baseline infusion programme and after 6 months. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of therapy, there was a dramatic improvement in Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, in nutritional and activity blood parameters, as well as in endoscopic and histological scores; 10 patients had a clinical remission (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index < or = 10), 12 patients had an inflammatory remission (decrease in both endoscopic and histological scores for > or = 50% as compared to baseline values). In all patients corticosteroids were stopped within 4 weeks after beginning infliximab therapy. After 6 months of therapy, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index was markedly lower than the pre-treatment value; however, it was significantly lower in patients on retreatment than in those who received only three infusions of infliximab. Furthermore, a significant increase in both weight and height Z scores was observed 6 months after beginning of the baseline infusion programme. Moreover, weight and height gain was significantly higher in patients on retreatment rather than in those treated only with three baseline infusions of infliximab. Mild infusion reactions controlled by slowing infusion rate were observed in four patients. No delayed hypersensitivity-like reactions were seen. CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe Crohn's disease, infliximab is a safe and valuable treatment in inducing remission, in healing inflammatory lesions of the gut, as documented by endoscopy and histology, and in promoting growth. Retreatment infusions of infliximab may be suggested in childhood-onset Crohn's disease to maintain remission and reverse growth failure.\",\n",

Phlebitis complicated four patients, two in the iodophor group and one in each of the remaining groups. Only one patient in the chlorhexidine group had septicaemia due to A. antitratus. Thirty-four catheter tips (22.7%) yielded bacteria on culture. Incidence of positive tip cultures was significantly higher in the chlorhexidine group than in the other two. The rates of positive tip cultures correlated with duration of catheterization. It is concluded that alcohol is the antiseptic of choice for cut down wounds.

Screening identified HDAC8-selective inhibitors including C149 (IC(50) = 0.070 muM), which was more potent than PCI-34058 (6) (IC(50) = 0.31 muM), a known HDAC8 inhibitor. Molecular modeling suggested that the phenylthiomethyl group of C149 binds to a unique hydrophobic pocket of HDAC8, and the orientation of the phenylthiomethyl and hydroxamate moieties (fixed by the triazole moiety) is important for the potency and selectivity. The inhibitors caused selective acetylation of cohesin in cells and exerted growth-inhibitory effects on T-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma cells (GI(50) = 3-80 muM).

Compliance with condom use was much the same in the two groups. Overall, N-9 reduced the rate of cervical infection by 25% (rate ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.5-1.1); in women who used N-9 for more than 75% of their coital acts the infection rate was reduced by 40% (RR 95% Cl 0.3-1.0). The rate of yeast vulvovaginitis or genital ulcers was not higher in N-9 users than in placebo users, but the rate of symptomatic irritation was increased by 70% (RR 95% Cl 1.1-2.6) among N-9 users. Condom use was more protective against cervical infection than N-9 use. The rate of infection was 50% (RR 95% Cl 0.3-0.7) lower with 75% than with 0-50% condom compliance.

The women were studied again on day 21 of the second cycle after they had taken for two months 200 mg vitamin E per day in addition to the contraceptive. At day 21 (after 3 weeks of hormonal contraceptive) as compared to day 5, there was a significant increase in the clotting activity of platelets and the response to ADP-induced aggregation concomitant with a decrease in plasma vitamin E. After vitamin E administration, platelet activity at day 21 was markedly decreased, being similar to the activity at day 5, with a significant increase in the level of vitamin E in plasma and platelets. The high response of platelets to aggregation in women using contraceptives does not seem to be associated with the intake of saturated fat but rather with that of 18:2. The aggregation to thrombin was mostly related to lanosterol biosynthesis and the aggregation to ADP to platelet cholesterol, but not to plasma lipids or apoproteins. The present pilot study suggests that the platelet hyperactivity of long-term hormonal contraceptive users might be dependent upon a low level of platelet alpha-tocopherol which can be rapidly overcome by giving a supplement of vitamin E.',\n",

An observational study estimated the prevalence of GS to 19/1,000,000, in Sweden, suggesting that approximately 1% of the population carries one mutant NCCT allele. As the phenotype of GS patients, who always carry two mutant alleles, is indistinguishable from that seen in patients treated with high-dose thiazide diuretics, we aimed at investigating whether subjects carrying one mutated NCCT allele have a phenotype resembling that of treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics. We screened first-degree relatives of 18 of our patients with an established clinical end genetic diagnosis of GS for NCCT loss of function mutations and identified 35 healthy subjects carrying one mutant allele (GS-heterozygotes). Each GS-heterozygote was assigned a healthy control subject matched for age, BMI and sex. GS-heterozygotes had markedly lower blood pressure (systolic 103.3 +/- 16.4 versus 123.2 +/- 19.4 mmHg; diastolic 62.5 +/- 10.5 versus 73.1 +/- 9.4 mmHg; P < 0.001) than controls. There was no significant difference between the groups either in plasma concentration or urinary excretion rate of electrolytes, however, GS-heterozygotes had higher fasting plasma glucose concentration. Similar to patients being treated with low-dose thiazide diuretics, GS-heterozygotes have markedly lower blood pressure and slightly higher fasting plasma glucose compared with control subjects. Our findings suggest that GS-heterozygotes, the prevalence of which can be estimated to 1%, are partially protected from hypertension through partial genetic loss of function of the NCCT. However, as our study had a case-control design, it is important to underline that any potential effects on population blood pressure and risk of future cardiovascular disease need to be examined in prospective and population-based studies.',\n",

To test whether MPTP toxicity involves alpha-synuclein, we generated alpha-synuclein-deficient mice by homologous recombination, and analyzed the effect of deleting alpha-synuclein on MPTP toxicity using these knockout mice. In addition, we examined commercially available mice that contain a spontaneous loss of the alpha-synuclein gene. As described previously, deletion of alpha-synuclein had no significant effects on brain structure or composition. In particular, the levels of synaptic proteins were not altered, and the concentrations of dopamine, dopamine metabolites, and dopaminergic proteins were unchanged. Upon acute MPTP challenge, alpha-synuclein knockout mice were partly protected from chronic depletion of nigrostriatal dopamine when compared with littermates of the same genetic background, whereas mice carrying the spontaneous deletion of the alpha-synuclein gene exhibited no protection. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein knockout mice but not the mice with the alpha-synuclein gene deletion were slightly more sensitive to methamphetamine than littermate control mice. These results demonstrate that alpha-synuclein is not obligatorily coupled to MPTP sensitivity, but can influence MPTP toxicity on some genetic backgrounds, and illustrate the need for extensive controls in studies aimed at describing the effects of mouse knockouts on MPTP sensitivity.\",\n",

In a university affiliated intensive care unit, all patients were eligible who required continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration and who did not have pre-existing coagulopathy or contraindications to heparin. New hemofilters were randomized to priming with 2 liters NS or 1 liter NS followed by 500ml NSA. The prime was recirculated for at least 30 minutes before connection to the patient. Anticoagulation was tightly controlled, aiming for a patient activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 60 seconds. Survival analysis was used to compare filter life. Elective discontinuation (e.g., for surgery) were treated as censored data. A total of 91 hemofilters were used in 40 patients during 9 months: 45 randomized to NS, and 46 to NSA. Of these, 57 hemofilters were used until spontaneous failure, 28 NS and 29 NSA; 34 hemofilters were electively discontinued, 17 in each group. Anticoagulation was identical in both groups; the mean APTT value (+/- SE) was 58.2 seconds (+/- 3.1) for NS and 58.0 seconds (+/- 2.8) for NSA (p > 0.9 unpaired t-test). Platelet counts were very similar at 170 x 10(9) (+/- 21.8) for NS and 181 x 10(9) (+/- 23.7) for NSA (p = 0.74 unpaired t-test).

Such actions have been linked to direct actions of insulin, or to cross occupation of closely linked IGF-1 receptors. In this work, we examined insulin support of peripheral nerve regenerative events in mice. Systemic insulin administration accelerated the reinnervation of foot interosseous endplates by motor axons after sciatic nerve transection and enhanced recovery of functional mouse hindpaw function. Similarly, insulin accelerated the regeneration-related maturation of myelinated fibers regrowing beyond a sciatic nerve crush injury. That such benefits might occur through direct signaling on axons was supported by immunohistochemical studies of expression with an antibody directed to the beta insulin receptor (IR) subunit. The proportion of sensory neurons expressing IRbeta increased ipsilateral to a similar sciatic crush injury in the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia. Insulin receptors, although widely expressed in axons, were also preferentially and intensely expressed on axons regrowing just beyond a peripheral nerve crush injury zone. The findings indicate that insulin imparts a substantial impact on regenerating peripheral nerve axons through upregulation of its expression following injury. Although the findings do not exclude insulin coactivating IGF-1 receptors during regeneration, its own receptors are present and available for action on injured nerves.',\n",

The fixed combination between troxerutin 150 mg and carbazochrome 1.5 mg (Fleboside ampoules) was previously shown to have a good efficacy and safety profile in non-surgical patients with acute uncomplicated hemorrhoids. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of the active combination in the treatment of post-hemorrhoidectomy patients. 30 patients were randomized to receive one of two treatments: troxerutin 150 mg and carbazochrome 1.5 mg, or placebo, i.m. 3 ml ampoules twice a day for five consecutive days after the surgical procedure, starting from the day of surgery. Efficacy parameters were assessed as follows: at baseline (T1), after the first administration (T2; day of surgery), the second day after the surgical procedure (T3), and the fifth day after the surgical procedure (T4); hemorrhoidal symptoms based on a visual analogue scale (VAS): pain, discharge, bleeding, inflammation, and pruritus; analgesic intake, if any; time to restore a physiological defecation; edema evaluation (based on a four-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe); camera pictures taken at T1 and T4 (in selected patients); and blood coagulation tests. Analysis between treatment groups revealed a highly significant difference at T3 and T4 for the total VAS score (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001, respectively) in favor of the active combination treatment. A statistically significant difference was also observed for bleeding and pruritus at T3 and for these two parameters and both inflammation and edema at T4 (p < 0.001) in favor of the active combination group. No adverse events were reported. Neither the active combination nor placebo affected blood coagulation tests.

It is shown that 1) the gain-characteristic from cones to horizontal cells is strongly nonlinear without feedback from horizontal cells, 2) the gain-characteristic between cones and horizontal cells becomes linear when feedback is active, and 3) horizontal cells feed back to cones via a linear mechanism. In a quantitative analysis, it will be shown that negative feedback linearizes the synaptic transmission between cones and horizontal cells. The physiological consequences are discussed.',\n",

METHOD: From February 1992 to May 1992, 1082 live patients (978 colostomies and 104 ileostomies) who had undergone surgery at least 6 months earlier were assessed in a multicentre national inquiry. RESULTS: More than 20% of the patients had not been informed before surgery of the possibility of a definitive stoma. In half of the cases, the stoma was well accepted psychologically and patient's primary reactions improved with time, especially in patients with ileostomy (p < 0.01) and patients under 60 years of age (p < 0.001). Patients were satisfied with their stoma appliance in 94% of the cases. Only 31% with colostomy performed irrigations. Life style was altered in 43% of the patients, especially those with ileostomies (p < 0.001). Sexual activity was disturbed in 55% of the colostomy patients and working life in 63% of the ileostomy patients. One-fourth of the patients were often followed by an enterostomal therapist and one-third were members of ostomate associations. CONCLUSIONS: Ileostomy appears to be more disabilitating than colostomy due to patient age and, unlike colostomy, the impossibility of irrigation. These findings emphasize the contribution of enterostomal therapy and the justified role of ostomate associations.\",\n",

Except for hostility, the differences between couples in subscales of self-esteem/body image, guilty, and all psychiatric symptoms reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). Among varied psychosocial responses of infertile couples, concordant response was demonstrated only in response to sexuality and physical condition.

RESULTS: Young adults with ADHD were significantly more likely than controls to be using mental health services, to report psychological problems, and to have fathered children. In addition, a trend indicated that young men with ADHD were more likely to have dropped out of high school but subsequently attained a graduate equivalency diploma. There was also a trend for young adults with ADHD to report a greater history of trouble with the law; however, the groups did not differ on current legal problems.

Despite these heterogeneous results, some general conclusions can be drawn from these studies: 1) n-PUFAs have potent effects on ion channels and calcium regulatory proteins that vary depending on the route of administration. Circulating (acute administration) n-3 PUFAs affect ion channels directly while incorporation (long-term supplementation) of these lipids into cell membranes indirectly alter cardiac electrical activity via alteration of membrane properties. 2) n-3 PUFAs reduce baseline HR and increase HRV via alterations in intrinsic pacemaker rate rather than from changes in cardiac autonomic neural regulation. 3) n-3 PUFAs may be only effective if given before electrophysiological or structural remodeling has begun and have no efficacy against atrial fibrillation. 5) Despite initial encouraging results, more recent clinical prevention and animal studies have not only failed to reduce sudden cardiac death but actually increased mortality in angina patients and increased rather than decreased malignant arrhythmias in animal models of regional ischemia. 6) Given the inconsistent benefits reported in clinical and experimental studies and the potential adverse actions on cardiac rhythm noted during myocardial ischemia, n-3 PUFA must be prescribed with caution and generalized recommendations to increase fish intake or to take n-3 PUFA supplements need to be reconsidered.',\n",

In Molecular Modeling: From Virtual Tools to Real Problems (Eds. Kumosinski, T.F. and Liebman, M.N.) ACS Symposium Series 576, Ch. 9:123-134, 1994, ACS Books, Washington DC). The refinement of the initial bovine alpha A model was achieved using a more accurate estimation of secondary structure by new/updated methods for analyzing the far UV-CD spectra and by neural network secondary structure predictions in combination with database searches. The spectroscopic study reveals that alpha-crystallin is not an all beta-sheet protein but contains approximately 17% alpha-helices, approximately 33% beta-structures and approximately 50% turns and coils. The refinement of the alpha A structure results in an elongate, asymmetric amphipathic molecule. The hydrophobic N-terminal domain imparts the driving force for subunit aggregation while the more flexible, polar C-terminal domain imparts aggregate solubility. In our quaternary structure of the aggregate, the monomer is the minimal cooperative subunit. In bovine alpha A, the highly negatively charged C-terminal domain has three small positive areas which may participate in dimer or tetramer formation of independently expressed C-terminal domains. The electrostatic potential of positive areas is modulated and become more negative with phosphorylation and ATP binding. The refined bovine alpha A model was used to construct alpha A models for the human, chick and dogfish shark. A high degree of conservation of the three dimensional structure and the electrostatic potential was observed. Our proposed open micellar quaternary structure correlates well with experimental data accumulated over the past several decades. The structure is also predictive of the more recent data.',\n",

METHODS: A retrospective review of 122 eyes of 70 treatment-naive diabetic patients who underwent diagnostic UWFA using the Optos 200Tx imaging system. Two independent, masked graders quantified the area of retinal ischaemia. Based on clinical examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT), each patient was given a binary classification as either having DMO or no DMO. McNemar's test (with Yates' correction as indicated) and a two-sample test of proportions were used to determine the relationship between DMO and ischaemia for binary and proportional data, respectively. Linear and logistic models were constructed using generalised estimating equations to test relationships between independent variables, covariates and outcomes while controlling for inter-eye correlation, age, gender, haemoglobin A1c, mean arterial pressure and dependence on insulin. RESULTS: Seventy-six eyes (62%) exhibited areas of retinal ischaemia. There was a significant direct correlation between DMO and peripheral retinal ischaemia as seen on UWFA (p<0.001). In addition, patients with retinal ischaemia had 3.75 times increased odds of having DMO compared with those without retinal ischaemia (CI 1.26 to 11.13, p<0.02). CONCLUSION: Retinal ischaemia is significantly correlated with DMO in treatment-naive patients with DR.

              "  \"In vivo microvoltammetry was used to detect dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release from nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of freely moving, male, Sprague-Dawley laboratory rats, while animals' locomotor (forward ambulations) and stereotypic behavior (fine movements of sniffing and grooming) were monitored at the same time with infrared photobeams. Monoamine release mechanisms were determined by using a depolarization blocker (gamma-butyrolactone, gamma BL). Miniature carbon sensors (BRODERICK PROBES microelectrodes) smaller than a human hair were used in conjunction with a semidifferential electrochemical circuit to detect release of each monoamine in separate signals and within seconds. The purpose was to evaluate the neuropharmacology of the 5-HT(2)/DA(2) antagonist risperidone in its current therapeutic role as an atypical antipsychotic medication as well as in its potential role as pharmacotherapy for cocaine psychosis and withdrawal symptoms. Acute (single drug dose) and subacute (24-h follow-up studies in the same animal, no drug administration) studies were performed for each treatment group. The hypothesis for the present studies is derived from a growing body of evidence that cocaine-induced psychosis and schizophrenic psychosis share similar neurochemical and behavioral manifestations. Results showed that (1) Acute administration of risperidone (2 mg/kg sc) significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc above baseline (habituation) values (P<.001) while locomotion and stereotypy were virtually unaffected. In subacute studies, DA release did not differ from baseline (P>.05), whereas 5-HT release was significantly increased above baseline (P<.001). Locomotion increased over baseline but not to a significant degree, while stereotypy was significantly increased above baseline (P<.05). (2) Acute administration of cocaine (10 mg/kg ip) significantly increased both DA and 5-HT release above baseline (P<.001), while locomotion and stereotypy were significantly increased over baseline (P<.001). In subacute studies, DA decreased significantly below baseline (P<.001) and significant decreases in 5-HT release occurred at 15, 20, 50 and 55 min (P<.05). Behavior increased above baseline but did not reach a statistically significant degree. (3) Acute administration of risperidone/cocaine (2 mg/kg sc and 10 mg/kg ip, respectively) showed a significant block of the cocaine-induced increase in DA release in the first hour (P<.001) and 5-HT release in both hours of study (P<.001). Cocaine-induced locomotion and stereotypy were blocked simultaneously with the monoamines (P<.001). In subacute studies, DA and 5-HT release returned to baseline while locomotion and stereotypy increased insignificantly above baseline. Thus, (a) these studies were able to tease out pharmacologically the critical differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic responses to drug treatment(s) and these differences may lead to more effective therapies for schizophrenic and/or cocaine psychosis. (b) Taken together with other data, these acute studies suggest that risperidone may possibly act via inhibition of presynaptic autoreceptors to produce the observed increases in accumbens DA and 5-HT release, whereas cocaine may be acting at least in part via serotoninergic modulation of DA postsynaptically. The subacute data suggest that pharmacokinetics may play a role in risperidone's action and that neuroadaptation may play a role in the mechanism of action of cocaine. Finally, the ability of risperidone to block cocaine-induced psychostimulant neurochemistry and behavior during acute studies while diminishing the withdrawal symptoms of cocaine during subacute studies suggests that risperidone may be a viable pharmacotherapy for cocaine psychosis and withdrawal.\",\n",

Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were cultured and randomly assigned to a control group and an extracellular vesicles (ECV) group. The ECV group was exposed to isolated Porphyromonas gingivalis extracellular vesicles; the control group was not exposed. Western blotting was used to detect expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). When human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were processed by Porphyromonas gingivalis extracellular vesicles (ECV), protein expression levels of both MMP-1 and TIMP-1 were significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, ALP mRNA expression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts processed by ECV was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). Porphyromonas gingivalis extracellular vesicles can up-regulate expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 protein and ALP mRNA of human periodontal fibroblasts.',\n",

PATIENTS: 20 adult patients with stable renal transplants given orally administered microemulsified cyclosporin and mycophenolate. METHODS: Cyclosporin was assayed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nonlinear regression and MAP Bayesian estimation were performed using a home-made program and a previously designed pharmacokinetic model including an S-shaped absorption profile described by a gamma distribution. OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: MAP Bayesian estimation using the best limited sampling strategy (before administration, and 1 and 3 hours after administration) was compared with nonlinear regression (taken as the reference method) for the prediction of the different pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure indices. Median relative prediction error was -0.49 and -3.42% for area under the concentration-time curve over the administration interval of 12 hours (AUC12) and estimated peak drug concentration (Cmax), respectively (nonsignificant). Relative precision was 2.00 and 4.32%, and correlation coefficient (r) was 0.985 and 0.955, for AUC12 and Cmax, respectively. CONCLUSION: This paper reports preliminary results in a stable renal transplant patient population, showing that MAP Bayesian estimation can allow accurate prediction of AUC12 and Cmax with only three samples (0, 1 and 3 hours). Although these results require confirmation by further studies in other clinical settings, using other drug combinations, other analytical methods and commercially available pharmacokinetic software, the method seems promising as a tool for the therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporin in clinical practice or for exposure-controlled studies.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively assess pattern of utilization of mental health services in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) during a 5-year period for all subjects exposed to Isotretinoin in comparison to a control group consisting of army conscripts suffering from psoriasis. All subjects were young adults (18 to 21 years old) in compulsory military service. METHOD: Exposure to Isotretinoin mandates reporting and marking as a coded medical profile in the IDFs' computerized medical record of each conscript and soldier. Medical data, tracked by military medical profiles, were summarized from medical records of all subjects treated by Isotretinion during the years 1999-2003 and for the control group for the same period. Use of mental health services was the a-priori defined primary outcome measure. RESULTS: During the study period 1419 subjects were exposed to Isotretinoin and 1102 suffered from psoriasis. Utilization of mental health services was highest for the index group wherein 17.2% (245/1419) of subjects were evaluated or treated compared to 12.5% in the control group (psoriasis). The inter-group differences were statistically significant; Chi-square=15.9 (df=2), p=0.0003. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that psychiatric evaluation be regularly undertaken prior to initiation of Isotretinion treatment in young adults at risk, as well as providing follow-up visits during and at completion of treatment.\",\n",

We retrospectively characterized all of the MAC isolates made in our laboratory in the last 18 years by sequence-based identification and genotyping, and compared the clinical and laboratory data for lymphadenitis-associated and non-lymphadenitis-associated MAC isolates. Of 67 MAC-infected patients, 25 lymphadenitis patients were significantly younger than 42 non-lymphadenitis patients, while the male/female ratio did not significantly differ between the two groups. Cervical topography found in 76.5% of lymphadenitis patients was significantly more frequent in non-immunocompromised patients (p=0.04). M. avium subsp. hominissuis was identified in 53 patients (24 lymphadenitis, 29 non-lymphadenitis), M. colombiense in six patients (five non-lymphadenitis, one lymphadenitis), M. intracellulare in four non-lymphadenitis patients, and M. chimaera in three non-lymphadenitis patients, while negative controls remained negative. M. hominissuis was significantly associated with lymphadenitis (p=0.03). M. hominissuis isolates yielded 15 genotypes in 29 non-lymphadenitis isolates (molecular diversity, 0.622) versus 11 genotypes in 24 lymphadenitis isolates (molecular diversity, 0.578), demonstrating a non-significant lower diversity of M. hominissuis isolates cultured from lymphadenitis.

This paper was designed to study the severity and prevalence of sleep disorders and the factors affecting the syndromes in this unique patient group. METHODS: We conducted this study by the use of questionnaires. Included in this study were a total of 245 patients at our center who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and who received hemodialysis thrice weekly for more than three months. Their demographic data and biochemical and hematologic parameters were analyzed. All patients were asked to complete two questionnaires (in a Chinese version) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II), either by themselves or with assistance from the medical staff. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four patients completed both questionnaires with a response rate of 70.4%. Their mean age was 57.9 +/- 11.8 (ranging from 23.1 to 83.7) years old. They had been receiving hemodialysis for an average of 49.1 +/- 50.9 months before the study. The male to female ratio was 77:87. Seventy six (46.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 74.4% (122/164), defined as PSQI scores >5. The poor sleepers had higher BDI scores and a higher ratio of females comparing to the good sleepers. By a multivariate analysis, the BDI scores and female sex were the independent predictors of the patients being poor sleepers. In analyzing the poor sleepers, the BDI scores, durations of hemodialysis and hemoglobin levels were the independent factors for predicting the global PSQI scores. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire showed a high prevalence of insomnia in the dialytic population. The study also attributes a predictive role in sleep quality to gender, depression, dialytic duration, and hemoglobin levels. The data indicate that in the management of insomnia in this patient group, anemia and depression, both of which are potentially correctable, should be assessed.',\n",

DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: Lactating mothers were randomised on day 5 post-partum to groups consuming equal numbers of capsules but containing either placebo or an oil containing DHA (43%) as its only polyunsaturate to receive 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.9, 1.3 g DHA/day. Breast milk fatty acids as well as maternal plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids were assessed at 12 weeks post partum by capillary gas chromatography.

METHODS: Two hundred ninety-eight pregnancies, including 39 T21 and seven T18 confirmed fetal aneuploidies, were analyzed using a novel, highly multiplexed assay, termed digital analysis of selected regions (DANSR). Cell-free DNA from maternal blood samples was analyzed using DANSR assays for loci on chromosomes 21 and 18. Products from 96 separate patients were pooled and sequenced together. A standard Z-test of chromosomal proportions was used to distinguish aneuploid samples from average-risk pregnancy samples. DANSR aneuploidy discrimination was evaluated at various sequence depths. RESULTS: At the lowest sequencing depth, corresponding to 204,000 sequencing counts per sample, average-risk cases where distinguished from T21 and T18 cases, with Z statistics for all cases exceeding 3.6. Increasing the sequencing depth to 410,000 counts per sample substantially improved separation of aneuploid and average-risk cases. A further increase to 620,000 counts per sample resulted in only marginal improvement. This depth of sequencing represents less than 5% of that required by massively parallel shotgun sequencing approaches.

At present, COPD is suboptimally managed; current health is often not measured properly and hardly taken into account in management plans, and the future risk for patients with regard to health status and quality of life is not being evaluated. This review addresses the effect of COPD on the lives of patients and examines ways in which existing assessment tools meet physicians' needs for a standardized, simple method to measure consistently the full impact of COPD on patients in routine clinical practice. Current assessment of COPD severity tends to focus on airflow limitation, but this does not capture the full impact of the disease and is not well correlated with patient perception of symptoms and health-related quality of life. Qualitative studies have demonstrated that patients usually consider COPD impact in terms of frequency and severity of symptoms, and physical and emotional wellbeing. However, patients often have difficulty expressing their disease burden and physicians generally have insufficient time to collect this information. Therefore, it is important that methods are implemented to help generate a more complete understanding of the impact of COPD. This can be achieved most efficiently using a quick, reliable, and standardized measure of disease impact, such as a short questionnaire that can be applied in daily clinical practice. Questionnaires are precision instruments that contribute sensitive and specific information, and can potentially help physicians provide optimal care for patients with COPD. Two short, easy-to-use, specific measures, ie, the COPD Assessment Test and the Clinical COPD Questionnaire, enable physicians to assess patients' health status accurately and improve disease management. Such questionnaires provide important measurements that can assist primary care physicians to capture the impact of COPD on patients' daily lives and wellbeing, and improve long-term COPD management.\",\n",

Obesity is also more prevalent in these patients than in the general population, and gets worse with time. It is a consequence of a diminished basal metabolic rate and a lower physical activity compared to that of matched controls, with a similar or lower caloric intake. Many different hormonal alterations that could be responsible for those changes in the energy balance have been found. Patients whose tumor involved the hypothalamus are more prone to develop obesity and its consequences. Cardiovascular risk factors are also more prevalent in these patients, leading to a high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sleep disturbances, dysfunction in thermoregulation and thirst and a lower bone mineral density can also be found. Although randomized clinical trials comparing different treatments are lacking, it looks like therapeutic strategies have a minor influence on the risk of long-term sequelae.',\n",

              "  'Human glioma is a malignancy that has no effective systemic therapy. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in various invasive and metastatic tumor cells. To investigate its prognostic value in human gliomas, which currently is unknown, we examined the expression patterns of FAK and its activated form, phospho-FAK (FAK pY397), and analyzed the correlation between their expression and prognosis in patients with gliomas. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect FAK and phospho-FAK expression patterns in the biopsies from 96 patients with primary gliomas. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis of patients. As a result, the immunohistochemical analysis revealed that FAK and phospho-FAK both were associated significantly with the Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score and World Health Organization (WHO) grades of patients with gliomas. Especially, the positive expression rates of FAK and phospho-FAK were significantly higher in patients with a higher grade (P = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) and a lower KPS score (P = 0.006 and 0.008, respectively). The patients with FAK positive expression correlated with a poor prognosis of human gliomas (P = 0.006) as well as phospho-FAK (P = 0.01). The survival rate of the patients with FAK+/phospho-FAK+ expression was the lowest (P < 0.05), and conjoined expressions of FAK/phospho-FAK were an independent prognostic indicator of human gliomas (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that the elevated expression of FAK and phospho-FAK is an important feature of human glioma. A combined detection of FAK/phospho-FAK coexpression may benefit us in the prediction of the prognosis of human glioma.',\n",
              "  \"The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed in 30% of human breast cancers. One of the mechanisms by which tumor cell proliferation can be inhibited consists in hampering HER2 dimerization by targeting its extracellular domain with specific antibodies. In recent clinical practice, a valuable alternative to entire IgGs resides in the use of smaller molecules, such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv), developed for selective molecular targeting. In this paper, we report on the production and purification of a soluble anti-HER2 scFv antibody secreted by Pichia pastoris. The gene encoding scFv800E6 with an additional 6x His-tag at the 3'-end was inserted into the expression vector pPICZalpha and transformed in P. pastoris. The highest expression level was obtained in presence of 0.5% methanol and 0.8% glycerol in the culture medium after 48 h of induction. The use of P. pastoris proved very valuable as an expression system, allowing the isolation of 10 mg/L of highly purified antibody, remarkably higher than previously reported data. The functionality of purified anti-HER2 scFv was assessed by cytofluorimetry and immunofluorescence on HER2-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells, showing good affinity and high selectivity for the target membrane receptor. These findings confirm that P. pastoris is a suitable host for high level expression of antibody fragments and highlight the potential role of scFv800E6 in diagnostic and therapeutic application.\",\n",

Despite introduction of novel endoscopic techniques and pharmacological treatment, 6-15% patients have to be operated. The aim of our investigation is analyze data of patients treated for gastrointestinal ulcer bleeding in our institution, their treatment options and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 2237 patients admitted in the Department for Emergency medicine of Clinical center of Serbia during the period from January 1999 until December 2003. because of gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding. We analyzed age, gender treatment option, hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of our patients was 61.58 years, 1346 male and 891 female. The majority of patients were conservatively treated (84.5%). Operated patients mostly undergo Billroth II resection (57.8%). The mean hospital stay was 7.3 days. Average mortality was 14.4%.

ApoE is expressed at high levels in hepatocytes, macrophages and astrocytes. In the present study, we identify nuclear and cytosolic pools of apoE in human fibroblasts. Fibroblast apoE mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated during staurosporine-induced apoptosis and this was correlated with increased caspase-3 activity and apoptotic morphological alterations. Because the transcription of apoE and specific pro-apoptotic genes is regulated by the nuclear receptor LXR (liver X receptor) alpha, we analysed LXRalpha mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR and found it to be increased before apoE mRNA induction. The expression of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) mRNA, which is also regulated by LXRalpha, was increased in parallel with apoE mRNA, indicating that LXRalpha probably promotes apoE and ABCA1 transcription during apoptosis. Fibroblast apoE levels were increased under conditions of serum-starvation-induced growth arrest and hyperoxia-induced senescence. In both cases, an increased nuclear apoE level was observed, particularly in cells that accumulated lipofuscin. Nuclear apoE was translocated to the cytosol when mitotic nuclear disassembly occurred and this was associated with an increase in total cellular apoE levels. ApoE amino acid sequence analysis indicated several potential sites for phosphorylation. In vivo studies, using 32P-labelling and immunoprecipitation, revealed that fibroblast apoE can be phosphorylated. These studies reveal novel associations and potential roles for apoE in fundamental cellular processes.',\n",

This study examined the use of health services by persons who have symptoms of mental distress that they say impair their ability to function. METHODS: A stratified field survey was conducted in central California to select a probabilistic sample of persons of Mexican origin. A multinomial logistic regression was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Among respondents who reported functional impairments attributable to their symptoms, 58 percent met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder. Of that group, 69 percent did not use any health services. Respondents who sought medical services for mental health symptoms were more likely to be women and to meet diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder. Respondents who sought mental health services for their symptoms were more likely to be female, to be unmarried, and to have had 12 or more years of education. Health insurance status was not associated with type of service used. CONCLUSIONS: Even among Mexican Americans who met diagnostic criteria for a mental illness, most did not use services of any sort, and many of those who sought treatment for their symptoms turned to medical and informal services.',\n",
              "  'BACKGROUND: Efatutazone (CS-7017), a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist, exerts anticancer activity in preclinical models. The authors conducted a phase 1 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of efatutazone. METHODS: Patients with advanced solid malignancies and no curative therapeutic options were enrolled to receive a given dose of efatutazone, administered orally (PO) twice daily for 6 weeks, in a 3 + 3 intercohort dose-escalation trial. After the third patient, patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded. Efatutazone dosing continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with measurement of efatutazone pharmacokinetics and plasma adiponectin levels. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received efatutazone at doses ranging from 0.10 to 1.15 mg PO twice daily. Dose escalation stopped when maximal impact on PPARgamma-related biomarkers had been reached before any protocol-defined maximum-tolerated dose level. On the basis of a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, the recommended phase 2 dose was 0.5 mg PO twice daily. A majority of patients experienced peripheral edema (53.3%), often requiring diuretics. Three episodes of dose-limiting toxicities, related to fluid retention, were noted in the 0.10-, 0.25-, and 1.15-mg cohorts. Of 31 treated patients, 27 were evaluable for response. A sustained partial response (PR; 690 days on therapy) was observed in a patient with myxoid liposarcoma. Ten additional patients had stable disease (SD) for >/=60 days. Exposures were approximately dose proportional, and adiponectin levels increased after 4 weeks of treatment at all dose levels. Immunohistochemistry of archived specimens demonstrated that PPARgamma and retinoid X receptor expression levels were significantly greater in patients with SD for >/=60 days or PR (P = .0079), suggesting a predictive biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: Efatutazone demonstrates acceptable tolerability with evidence of disease control in patients with advanced malignancies.',\n",

Postmenopausal women (n = 13) ate two diets that were similar, except that, in one diet, 25 g high-isoflavone soy protein (SOY) was substituted for an equivalent amount of meat protein (control diet), for 7 wk each in a randomized crossover design. After 3 wk of equilibration, calcium retention was measured by labeling the 2-d menu with (47)Ca, followed by whole-body counting for 28 d. Urinary calcium and renal acid excretion were measured at wk 3, 5, and 7. Biomarkers of bone and cardiovascular health were measured at the beginning and end of each diet. Calcium was similarly retained during the control and SOY diets (d 28, percent dose, mean +/- pooled sd: 14.1 and 14.0 +/- 1.6, respectively). Despite a 15-20% lower renal acid excretion during the SOY diet, urinary calcium loss was unaffected by diet. Diet also did not affect any of the indicators of bone or cardiovascular health.

METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into a model group of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and a sham-operated (SO) group. The SAP rats were further divided into two subgroups on the basis of tongue-coating status: a thick greasy tongue fur group (SAP-TGF) and a normal tongue fur group (SAP-NF). Six rats were chosen randomly from every group mentioned above for an Evans blue assay 5 days after model establishment. For the histomorphology analysis, the expressions of ZO-1 protein and mRNA were studied by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, transmission electron microscope, Western blot, and Q-PCR using blood and tongue tissues, which were collected from 8 rats randomly chosen from each group. RESULTS: The papillae density of the rat tongue surface and the caryocinesis frequency of the basal layer were significantly increased in the SAP-TGF group compared with the SO group (P<0.05). Evans blue levels in the tongue tissue of the SAP-TGF group were significantly higher than that of the SO and SAP-NF groups (P<0.05). Vascular ECs were wider and obviously fissured in the SAP-TGF group under transmission electron microscope observation. The protein and mRNA expression of ZO-1 in the SAP-TGF group were lower than those in the SAP-NF (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive activity enhancement of glossal epithelial cells was one of the main characteristics of thick greasy tongue fur formation. An increase in vasopermeability was closely associated with thick greasy tongue fur formation. Tight junction structural variation of vascular ECs might play an important role in the pathological and physiological process of thick greasy tongue fur formation.',\n",
              "  'Src kinase is an attractive target for drug development based on its established relationship with cancer and possible link to hypertension. The suitability of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds as potential drug ligands for further biological evaluation was investigated using structure-based, ligand-based, and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. Isopraeroside IV, 9alpha-hydroxyfraxinellone-9-O-beta-D-glucoside (9HFG) and aurantiamide were the top three TCM candidates identified from docking. Hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were the primary forces governing docking stability. Their stability with Src kinase under a dynamic state was further validated through MD and torsion angle analysis. Complexes formed by TCM candidates have lower total energy estimates than the control Sacaratinib. Four quantitative-structural activity relationship (QSAR) in silico verifications consistently suggested that the TCM candidates have bioactive properties. Docking conformations of 9HFG and aurantiamide in the Src kinase ATP binding site suggest potential inhibitor-like characteristics, including competitive binding at the ATP binding site (Lys295) and stabilization of the catalytic cleft integrity. The TCM candidates have significantly lower ligand internal energies and are estimated to form more stable complexes with Src kinase than Saracatinib. Structure-based and ligand-based analysis support the drug-like potential of 9HFG and aurantiamide and binding mechanisms reveal the tendency of these two candidates to compete for the ATP binding site.',\n",

METHODS: Two Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, ATCC 12228 and ATCC 35984 (biofilm-producer), and an Enterococcus faecalis strain (KOS1, clinical isolate from an endophthalmitis patient) were used. Biofilms were cultivated on disks of different IOL materials: hydrogel, PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), and acrylic. Biofilms were stained with crystal violet (CV), which served as an index of biofilm formation. The bacterial population was enumerated after biofilm homogenization. Biofilms were also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). IOLs were presoaked in two antibiotics, levofloxacin (LVFX) and gatifloxacin (GFLX), and then the bacterial population was enumerated. As in vivo experiment, antibiotics-treated and nontreated Meridian IOLs were implanted in rabbit eyes, which served as an endophthalmitis model, and the bacterial population was enumerated. RESULTS: The amount of biofilm formed was the least on hydrogel from among the three materials tested after 48- and 72-hr incubation (p < 0.05 to 0.01). The bacterial population was the least on hydrogel from among the three materials with ATCC 12228 (p < 0.05 to 0.01), and the bacterial population was significantly different between hydrogel and acrylic after 72-hr incubation with ATCC 35984 (p < 0.05). Biofilm by the two S. epidermidis strains were recognized after 24-hr incubation. Rates of biofilm-positive SEM fields, which were defined as being occupied by biofilm over at least half of the area, were increased through 72 hr with ATCC 35984. While the E. faecalis strain showed no bacterial adherence on the antibiotics-treated hydrogel IOLs, adherence of the S. epidermidis strain, ATCC 35984 was recognized on the LVFX-treated IOLs after 48-hr incubation (103 to 104 CFU/ml). In the rabbit in vivo model, the bacterial populations in eyes with an antibiotics-treated Meridian IOL were significantly smaller than in eyes with a nontreated IOL for 72 hr after surgery (p < 0.05 to 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The biofilm formation was less on hydrogel than on other two materials tested. Hydrogel presoaked in antibiotics exhibited a preventive effect against biofilm formation at least for 24 hr in vitro and against bacterial proliferation in the rabbit in vivo endophthalmitis model.',\n",

Aneuploidy was observed in 66% of tumors and more than one aneuploid peak was present in 12%. The frequency of aneuploid tumors was higher in rectal (80%) and left-colon (70%) cancers than in right-colon cancers (51%), and multiple aneuploid clones were detected more frequently in men than in women (p = 0.03) and more frequently in advanced Dukes' D-stage patients (p = 0.08). The median [3H]dT LI value (17.4%) was similar to the FCM-S value determined by a planimetric model (16.2%) and somewhat higher than the FMC-S value obtained by an optimization procedure (11.2%). However, there was no significant relationship between the [3H]dT LI value and either FCM-S value for individual tumors. Moreover, FCM-S values were higher in aneuploid than in diploid tumors, whereas [3H]dT LI values were independent of DNA-ploidy status; [3H]dT LI and FCM-S were also related differently to some clinical and pathological features such as tumor site and histology. These findings suggest different biological meanings for these 2 cell-kinetic parameters, which should not be used interchangeably.\",\n",

ANIMALS: 945 horses of white-patterned bloodlines and 55 solid-colored horses of other breeds. PROCEDURE: Horses were genotyped by use of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction to determine incidence of the Ile118Lys EDNRB mutation. RESULTS: Genotypes detected were homozygous Ile118, homozygous Lys118, and heterozygous. All foals with OLWS were homozygous for the Ile118Lys EDNRB mutation, and adults that were homozygous were not found. White patterning was strongly associated with EDNRB genotype. Color patterns with highest incidence (> 94%) of heterozygotes were frame overo, highly white calico overo, and frame blend overo. White-patterned bloodlines with lowest incidence of heterozygotes (< 21 %) were tobiano, sabino, minimally white calico overo, splashed white overo, nonframe blend overo, and breeding-stock solid. The mutation was not detected in solid-colored horses from breeds without white patterning. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In homozygotes, the Ile118Lys EDNRB mutation causes OLWS. In heterozygotes, the mutation is usually responsible for a frame overo phenotype. The frame pattern can be combined with other white patterns, making accurate estimation of EDNRB genotype by visual inspection difficult. Wide range of incidence of heterozygotes in various subtypes of white-patterned horses indicates different genetic control of these color patterns. Determination of EDNRB genotype by use of a DNA-based test is the only way to determine with certainty whether white-patterned horses can produce a foal affected with OLWS.',\n",

It is missed by the cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement technique. Currently, quantifying diffuse myocardial fibrosis requires invasive biopsy, with inherent risk and sampling error. We have developed a robust and noninvasive technique, equilibrium contrast CMR (EQ-CMR) to quantify diffuse fibrosis and have validated it against the current gold standard of surgical myocardial biopsy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 3 principles of EQ-CMR are a bolus of extracellular gadolinium contrast followed by continuous infusion to achieve equilibrium; a blood sample to measure blood volume of distribution (1-hematocrit); and CMR to measure pre- and postequilibrium T1 (with heart rate correction). The myocardial volume of distribution is calculated, reflecting diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Clinical validation occurred in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis or myectomy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=18 and n=8, respectively). Surgical biopsies were analyzed for picrosirius red fibrosis quantification on histology. The mean histological fibrosis was 20.5+/-11% in aortic stenosis and 17.1+/-7.4% in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. EQ-CMR correlated strongly with biopsy histological fibrosis: aortic stenosis, r(2)=0.86, Kendall Tau coefficient (T)=0.71, P<0.001; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, r(2)=0.62, T=0.52, P=0.08; combined r(2)=0.80, T=0.67, P<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated a new technique, EQ-CMR, to measure diffuse myocardial fibrosis as an add-on to a standard CMR scan, which allows for the noninvasive quantification of the diffuse fibrosis burden in myocardial diseases.',\n",

In groupe I patients (n = 11), a Swan-Ganz catheter with optic fibres emitting light characterized by three different wavelengths was used (Opticath Oximetrix). In groupe II patients (n = 8), a Sat-one Edwards catheter was used instead (only two different wavelengths). All the patients were studied in the early stages of shock, once all the calibration procedures had been carried out. An increase in FIO2, using PEEP, fluid replacement therapy and vasoactive drugs or diuretics all improved the cardio-respiratory status of each patient. After each new therapeutic procedure, SVO2 was measured in blood samples obtained from these catheters, and from the pulmonary artery (to give the reference value, using an OSM3 Hemoximeter). Over a period of 1.5 to 6 h, 119 measurements were carried out in Group I, and 91 in Group II. The correlation coefficient was higher with the Oximetrix catheter than with the Edwards one (r = 0.970 and 0.855 respectively; p less than 0.001). Moreover, the 24 h spontaneous drift of the former catheter was less than that of the latter (+3.3 +/- 3.1% vs. +9.3 +/- 7%, p less than 0.05). This study showed that a catheter with optic fibres emitting a light with three wavelengths is more accurate than one emitting only two for the measurement of changes in SVO2 in critically ill patients.',\n",
              "  'BACKGROUND: Current markers for prostate cancer, such as PSA lack specificity. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed. Unfortunately, the complexity of body fluids often hampers biomarker discovery. An attractive alternative approach is the isolation of small vesicles, i.e. exosomes, approximately 100 nm, which contain proteins that are specific to the tissue from which they are derived and therefore can be considered as treasure chests for disease-specific biomarker discovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from 2 immortalized primary prostate epithelial cells (PNT2C2 and RWPE-1) and 2 PCa cell lines (PC346C and VCaP) by ultracentrifugation. After tryptic digestion, proteomic analyses utilized a nanoLC coupled with an LTQ-Orbitrap operated in tandem MS (MS/MS) mode. Accurate Mass and Time (AMT) tag approach was employed for peptide identification and quantitation. Candidate biomarkers were validated by Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Proteomic characterization resulted in the identification of 248, 233, 169, and 216 proteins by at least 2 peptides in exosomes from PNT2C2, RWPE-1, PC346C, and VCaP, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed 52 proteins differently abundant between PCa and control cells, 9 of which were more abundant in PCa. Validation by Western blotting confirmed a higher abundance of FASN, XPO1 and PDCD6IP (ALIX) in PCa exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of exosomal proteins using high performance LC-FTMS resulted in the discovery of PDCD6IP, FASN, XPO1 and ENO1 as new candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer.',\n",

One hundred and two laboratory technicians from HUSM and 79 from KKM Hospitals were selected and 84 (82.4%) from HUSM and 71 (89.9%) from KKM Hospitals were recruited as study subjects. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire using the validated Malay version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), originally developed by Robert Karasek. The results indicated significant associations between the risk factors of job-related depression, and low social support, and high psychological demands (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.8) in laboratory technicians in HUSM. However, for laboratory technicians in KKM Hospitals, the significant association was between job-related depression, and low social support and low decision authority (OR 9.7, 95% CI 1.1-91.1). Low social support was highly associated with job-related depression in laboratory technicians in HUSM and KKM Hospitals. We, therefore, conclude that low social support positively predicted depression in laboratory technicians in HUSM and KKM Hospitals. In addition, high psychological demands also significantly predicted depression in laboratory technicians in HUSM; however, for laboratory technicians in KKM Hospitals, low decision authority was the significant predictor of depression.',\n",

In the study reported here, we have shown abnormal up-regulation of germinal center B cell-associated GANP in various human lymphomas including mantle cell, diffuse large B cell, and Hodgkin lymphoma, by immunohistochemical analysis. To study the role of GANP in lymphomagenesis, we generated mutant mice (ganp-Tg) that express the transgenic ganp gene under immunoglobulin enhancer and promoter control. Ganp-Tg mice showed a high incidence of lymphomagenesis (29.5%) after aging with a non-B/non-T cell surface phenotype having slight CD45R/B220 expression and Ig transcripts of rearranged VH-DH-JH IgH loci. Lymphomas generated in ganp-Tg mice displayed similar pathologic characteristics to mouse reticulum cell neoplasm or Hodgkin lymphoma-like lesions. The VH sequences of individual mice showed that the tumors proliferated from a single clone or oligoclones, as is found in human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. These results suggest that GANP overexpression is a causative factor in the generation of B lymphomas.',\n",
              "  \"Since their discovery almost a century ago, bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or 'phages') have been used to prevent and treat a multitude of bacterial infections (phage therapy: PT). In addition, they have been the basis for many advances in genetics and biochemistry. Phage therapy was performed on human subjects in the United States, Europe and Asia in the few decades following their discovery. However, Western countries largely abandoned PT in favour of antibiotics in the 1940s. The relatively recent renaissance of PT in the West can be attributed partly to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human and animal pathogens. However, the stringent controls on human trials now required in the United States and Europe have led to a greater number of domestic animal and agricultural applications as an alternative to PT in man. This trend is set to continue, at least in the short term, with recent approval from the Food and Drug Administration allowing commercial phage treatments to be used in human food in the USA. Nevertheless, despite these significant milestones and the growing number of successful PT trials, significant obstacles remain to their widespread use in animals, food and ultimately medicine in many parts of the world. This review will provide a brief overview of the history of PT in the West and will summarize some of the key findings of phage biocontrol studies in animals and meat products.\",\n",
              "  'Emotion researchers often categorize angry and fearful face stimuli as \"negative\" or \"threatening\". Perception of fear and anger, however, appears to be mediated by dissociable neural circuitries and often elicit distinguishable behavioral responses. The authors sought to elucidate whether viewing anger and fear expressions produce dissociable psychophysiological responses (i.e., the startle reflex). The results of two experiments using different facial stimulus sets (representing anger, fear, neutral, and happy) indicated that viewing anger was associated with a significantly heightened startle response (p < .05) relative to viewing fear, happy, and neutral. This finding suggests that while anger and fear faces convey messages of \"threat\", their priming effect on startle circuitry differs. Thus, angry expressions, representing viewer-directed threat with an unambiguous source (i.e., the expresser), may more effectively induce a motivational propensity to withdraw or escape. The source of threat is comparatively less clear for fearful faces. The differential effects of these two facial threat signals on the defensive motivational system adds to growing literature highlighting the importance of distinguishing between emotional stimuli of similar valence, along lines of meaning and functional impact.',\n",

Thus we conducted this survey of physicians in urban hospitals in China to determine the size of the gap between research evidence and physicians' knowledge and practice regarding antihypertensive drugs for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in China. METHODS: A cross sectional survey by a face-to-face interview was conducted in 20 tertiary general hospitals in China in 2005. A total of 444 physicians (mostly cardiologists) in internal medicine who had treated at least one hypertensive patient in the past 12 months were invited for the interview on their perception of the cardiovascular risk of hypertension, the magnitude of the benefit of antihypertensive drugs, knowledge on the overall risk approach, first-line drugs used, the risk above which drug treatment is recommended, and knowledge on evidence-based medicine. RESULTS: A total of 444 of the 468 eligible physicians were successfully interviewed with a response rate of 94.9%. They estimated that a hypertensive man with an actual 5-year cardiovascular risk of 8.4% would have a 5-year cardiovascular risk of 40% (95%CI: 38% to 42%) if not treated, and have an absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction from drug treatment by 20% (95%CI: 18% to 22%) and 39% (95%CI: 37% to 42%) respectively, as compared to 3.3% and 33% respectively shown in research evidence. On average, the physicians would recommend drug treatment at a number needed to treat (NNT) of 368 or smaller, as compared to the actual NNT of 50 for drug treatment in an average hypertensive Chinese. Fifty-five percent (95%CI: 50% to 59%) of them had never intently used the national hypertension guidelines. The majority still prescribed drugs primarily based on blood pressure alone by ignoring other risk factors or the overall risk and 78% (95 % CI: 76% to 83%) used new expensive drugs such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line treatment. Only 13% (95%CI: 9% to 18%) could correctly interpret the NNT. Forty-three percent (95%CI: 39% to 48%) did not know the randomized controlled trial was scientifically the most rigorous among other study designs for evaluating the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs. Ninety-two percent (95%CI: 90% to 94%) did not know they could start by searching systematic reviews when looking for evidence on the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs as opposed to trials. Ninety-six percent (95%CI: 94% to 98%) did not know the Cochrane Library was an important source of systematic reviews. CONCLUSIONS: The surveyed physicians significantly over-estimated the cardiovascular risk of hypertension and the benefit of drug treatment, and had insufficient knowledge on the overall risk approach. They recommended drug treatment at a cardiovascular risk which was even much lower than the cutoff suggested for western populations, which would make many more people eligible for drug treatment. They also tended to prescribe new expensive drugs although the older cheaper ones may be more appropriate in many patients. They showed inappropriate knowledge on the basics of evidence-based medicine.\",\n",

The resultant fusion proteins have constitutive PDGFbetaR tyrosine kinase activity, but the partner genes previously reported (tel, Huntingtin interacting protein 1 [HIP-1], H4/D10S170) have poorly understood roles in the oncogenic activity of the fusion proteins. A novel PDGFbetaR fusion protein has been characterized in a patient with CMML and an acquired t(5;17)(q33;p13). Southern blot analysis on patient leukemia cells demonstrated involvement of the PDGFbetaR gene. Using 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) on patient RNA, rabaptin-5 was identified as a novel partner fused in-frame to the PDGFbetaR gene. The new fusion protein includes more than 85% of the native Rabaptin-5 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFbetaR. Transduction with a retroviral vector expressing rabaptin-5/PDGFbetaR transformed the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 to growth factor independence and caused a fatal myeloproliferative disease in mice. Rabaptin-5 is a well-studied protein shown to be an essential and rate-limiting component of early endosomal fusion through interaction with the Ras family GTPases Rab5 and Rab4. The fusion protein includes 3 of 4 coiled-coil domains (involved in homodimerization of native rabaptin-5), 2 caspase-3 cleavage sites, and a binding site for the tumor suppressor gene tuberin (tuberous sclerosis complex-2). Early endosomal transport is critical in regulation of various growth factor receptors, through ligand-induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and thus this new fusion protein links together 2 important pathways of growth regulation.\",\n",

Evidence suggests that IL-12 is dominant in early atherosclerosis, while IL-18 is critical in advanced atherosclerosis. In this study, we explore the association between IL-12 and IL-18 and arterial stiffness in healthy individuals. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study examining pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), IL-12, and IL-18 in healthy individuals (N = 53) without CVD risk factors. RESULTS: In multivariate regression, age (P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.05), and IL-12 (P < 0.01) were positively associated with PWV, and high-density lipoprotein (P = 0.04) was negatively associated with PWV (model R (2) = 0.476, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: IL-12, but not IL-18, is associated with PWV in healthy individuals without clinical CVD, supporting a role for IL-12 in early atherosclerosis as suggested by animal studies.',\n",

METHODS: A Markov-model for HPV-infection and cervical cancer was developed for the German health care context, and applied to evaluate various screening strategies that differ by screening interval and test algorithms, including HPV-testing alone or in combination with cytology. German clinical, epidemiological, and economic data, and test accuracy data from international meta-analyses were used. Outcomes predicted included the reduction in cervical cancer cases and deaths, life expectancy and discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). The analysis was performed from the perspective of the healthcare system adopting a 3% annual discount rate for costs and outcomes. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology alone. It results in a 71-97% reduction in cervical cancer cases as compared to 53-93% for cytology alone. The ICER range from 2600 Euro/LYG (cytology, 5-year-interval) to 155,500 Euro/LYG (annual HPV-testing starting at age 30 years, cytology age 20-29 years). Annual cytology alone, the current recommended screening strategy in Germany, is dominated by HPV-strategies. Increasing the age at screening initiation from 20 to 25 years does not result in a relevant loss in effectiveness but results in lower costs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analyses, HPV-based cervical cancer screening is more effective than cytology alone and could be cost-effective if performed at intervals of two years or longer. In the German context, an optimal screening strategy may be biennial HPV screening starting at age 30 years preceded by biennial cytology for women aged 25-29 years. Longer screening intervals may be considered in low-risk women with good screening adherence and in populations with low HPV-incidence.',\n",

Infertility affects the quality of life. In post-pubescent boys and men semen can be frozen for later use prior to treatment that harms the spermatogenesis. In girls and young women the solution for reduced fertility or infertility after ovary damaging treatment, may consist of the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue prior to this treatment. At a later stage a decision can be made to transplant this ovarian tissue into the patient or to follow an IVF procedure. There are important normative questions regarding this experimental treatment. The main question is, whether it may be introduced in health care as a regular treatment or should be subject to medical research first. In the Netherlands, a working party of both doctors and ethical, legal and psychological experts recommended to carry out proper research before introducing ovarian tissue cryopreservation in regular health care.

              "  \"In expanded CAG repeat diseases such as Huntington's disease, proteins containing polyglutamine (poly(Gln)) sequences with repeat lengths of about 37 residues or more are associated with development of both disease symptoms and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). Disease physiology in animal and cellular models does not always correlate with NII formation, however, and the mechanism by which aggregate formation might lead to cytotoxicity is unknown. To help evaluate various possible mechanisms, we determined the biophysical properties of a series of simple poly(Gln) peptides. The circular dichroism spectra of poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths of five, 15, 28 and 44 residues are all nearly identical and are consistent with a high degree of random coil structure, suggesting that the length-dependence of disease is not related to a conformational change in the monomeric states of expanded poly(Gln) sequences. In contrast, there is a dramatic increase in both the kinetics and the thermodynamic favorability of the spontaneous formation of ordered, amyloid-like aggregates for poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths of greater than 37 residues. At the same time, poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths in the 15-20 residue range, despite their poor abilities to support spontaneous, self-nucleated aggregation, are capable of efficiently adding to an already-formed aggregate. We also find that morphologically small, finely divided aggregates are much more efficient at recruiting poly(Gln) peptides than are large aggregates, suggesting a possible explanation for why disease pathology does not always correlate with the observable NII burden. Together, these data are consistent with a model for disease pathology in which critical cellular proteins possessing poly(Gln) sequences of modest length become inactivated when they are recruited into aggregates of an expanded poly(Gln) protein.\",\n",

Twenty-two cancer patients were treated for BRONJ with one of the following protocols: clinical (pharmacological therapy), surgical (pharmacological plus surgical therapy), or PRP plus LPT (pharmacological plus surgical plus platelet rich plasma (PRP) plus laser phototherapy (LPT). The laser treatment was applied with a continuous diode laser (InGaAlP, 660 nm) using punctual and contact mode, 40 mW, spot size 0.042 cm(2), 6 J/cm(2) (6 s) and total energy of 0.24 J per point. The irradiations were performed on the exposed bone and surrounding soft tissue. The analysis of demographic data and risk factors was performed by gathering the following information: age, gender, primary tumor, bisphosphonate (BP) used, duration of BP intake, history of chemotherapy, use of steroids, and medical history of diabetes. The association between the current state of BRONJ (with or without bone exposure) and other qualitative variables was determined using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. In all tests, the significance level adopted was 5%. Most BRONJ lesions occurred in the mandible (77%) after tooth extraction (55%) and in women (72%). A significantly higher percentage of patients reached the current state of BRONJ without bone exposure (86%) in the PPR plus LPT group than in the pharmacological (0%) and surgical (40%) groups after 1-month follow-up assessment. These results suggest that the association of pharmacological therapy and surgical therapy with PRP plus LPT significantly improves BRONJ healing in oncologic patients. Although prospective studies with larger sample sizes are still needed, this preliminary study may be used to inform a better-designed future study.\",\n",

The psychiatrist/patient relationship was supported and improved by well-trained, empathetic interpreters who assisted with the evaluation which stressed thorough history-taking and a mental status exam. Cultural differences and the psychiatrist's attitudes about refugees and the Indochinese war influenced the therapeutic process. Treatment consisted of appropriate medication, involvement with the social agencies when necessary, and the warmth, empathy, and support of the physician. In particular, it was helpful to understand the symptoms as the patient perceived them and to relate them to possible stresses in the past. Problem areas of therapy were the patient's concentration on physical symptoms, the horror stories, and taboo subjects difficult for the refugee to discuss. Case histories point out the conflict of values and cultural attitudes about mental illness among refugees due to their changed environment and life style.\",\n",

Consequently, broad-spectrum antibacterials, such as carbapenems, whose resistance has been highly modified, have been selected for use from the initial stage of these infections, and this is one reason for the increase in drug-resistant bacteria. We carried out this study to show antibiotics that are appropriate for each period of such infections. Bacteria obtained from postoperative infection sites in 114 patients with surgical site infections after gastrointestinal surgery were classified as first, second, third, and fourth isolates: the first isolates were taken when the administration of prophylactic antibiotics was finished, and the second, third, and fourth isolates were taken when the administrations of the first, second, and third therapeutic antibiotics, respectively, were finished. The incidence of drug-resistant strains was rare in strains isolated in the early phase of infections. The numbers of strains resistant to cephems and carbapenems increased as the clinical course of the infection progressed. New broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems should not be selected for the treatment of early-phase surgical site infections.',\n",

Therefore, our objective was to determine if low vitamin D levels predicted vascular complications of diabetes. METHODS: Prospective analysis of 936 veterans with type 2 diabetes (59.7 +/- 8.4 years, 96.9% male) who participated in the Veteran Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) was conducted. 25(OH)-vitamin D was measured a median of two years after entry and participants were subsequently followed 3.7 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for cardiovascular endpoints in relation to 25(OH)-vitamin D quartile. For microvascular endpoints, logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, minority status, treatment arm and history of prior event, individuals in the lowest vitamin D quartile (i.e., 1-15.9 ng/ml) were at similar risk of MI [HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 0.53, 2.42)], CHD [HR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.55)], congestive heart failure [HR = 1.44 (95% CI: 0.67, 3.06)], and death from any cause [HR = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.53, 2.04)] as individuals in the highest vitamin D quartile (i.e., 29.9-77.2 ng/ml). Similarly, there were no differences in the odds associated with retinopathy or renal disease onset or progression in the lowest versus highest vitamin D quartile. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that vitamin D status had no significant impact on the incidence of vascular events in a cohort of high-risk veterans with diabetes in which traditional risk factors were managed according to current treatment guidelines.',\n",

All HCV-seropositive patients underwent detailed clinical, laboratory, virologic, and histologic study to analyze the course of HCV infection. One hundred seventeen of the 658 patients (17.8%) were positive for HCV infection markers. Among the 117 anti-HCV+ patients, 41 (35%) were also positive for markers of hepatitis B virus infection with or without delta virus infection markers, 91 (77.8%) had previously received blood product transfusions, and 25 (21.4%) showed a normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level during the last 5-year follow-up (11 of them never had abnormal ALT levels). The remaining 92 patients showed ALT levels higher than the upper limit of normal range. Eighty-one of 117 (70%) anti-HCV+ patients were HCV-RNA+, with genotype 1b being present in most patients (54%). In univariate analysis, no risk factor for chronic liver disease was statistically significant. In this study, the prevalence of HCV infection was high in patients who were treated for a childhood malignancy. In about 20% of anti-HCV+ patients, routes other than blood transfusions are to be considered in the epidemiology of HCV infection. After a 14-year median follow-up, chronic liver disease of anti-HCV+ positive patients did not show progression to liver failure.',\n",

DKD, which manifests in children and adolescents, remains the leading cause of renal failure and dialysis in the Western world (4). While diabetic glomerulopathy has received significant attention from researchers, determinants of tubular injury in diabetes are less well examined. Compared to glomerular injury, tubular injury is known to associate better with renal function. The majority of youth diagnosed with T1D in the US present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition associated with risks factors for tubular injury including dehydration, metabolic acidosis and acute glycemia. It is unknown whether DKA is associated with tubular injury. The investigators published the first report showing that youth with established T1D have more acidic urine and higher fractional excretion of uric acid (FeUA) than their non-diabetic peers, which may predispose to UUA-mediated tubulopathy. Furthermore, T1D is associated with vasopressin overactivity, and the investigators reported strong relationships between serum copeptin, a reliable surrogate marker for vasopressin, and DKD in T1D. The overarching goals of this study are to determine whether tubular dysfunction (elevated urine sodium, bicarbonate and amino acids) and injury (elevated KIM-1, NGAL and MMP9) exist in new onset DKA, whether it is reversible and whether it is related to uricosuria and copeptin. The investigators propose to study a cohort of youth (ages 3-18, n=40) with new onset T1D who have serum and urine collection at DKA diagnosis and 3-month follow-up.',\n",

We have compared five documented methods of IVB collection: perfusion, incision, biopsy, tissue grinding, and puncture (prick) for fetal blood contamination and mononuclear cell profiles using flow cytometry. Twenty-five placentas were obtained from Plasmodium falciparum and human immunodeficiency virus-negative primigravid and secundigravid women delivering at Nyanza Provincial Hospital in Kisumu, western Kenya. Each of the five methods was performed on the same placenta. Fetal red blood cell contamination was significantly lower for the prick and perfusion methods (4.1% and 8.3%, respectively) than for incision (59.5%), biopsy (42.6%), and tissue grinding (19.9%). Significant variation was noted among the five methods in the percentages of monocytes, total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Further, a pairwise comparison of prick and perfusion, the two methods with low fetal blood contamination, showed that they were not different for fetal red blood cell contamination levels; however, prick yielded significantly higher percentages of CD4 T cells and CD4 memory T cells than perfusion. Collection by prick was determined to be the best method of intervillous blood collection for immunology studies, and perfusion represented the next best method of choice due to high sample volume yield. Overall, in considering the advantages/disadvantages of the two methods with low fetal cell contamination, we conclude that a combination of prick and perfusion is most suitable for immunology studies.',\n",

PTSD treatment programs are being developed throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Veterans Affairs (VA), but because of the large number of Service Members returning from deployment with PTSD, it is often necessary to provide psychotherapy in groups. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for PTSD, was originally developed as a group-based intervention. However, group-based CPT treatment has never been systematically compared to individual CPT treatment. The public policy implications of the results of this trial are significant. If both treatment formats are equivalent or if group treatment is better, then group treatment would be a more efficient and cost-effective therapy modality in most cases. On the other hand, if individual therapy is found to be superior, the investment of greater resources into individual therapy will be justified in order to provide the most effective treatment for PTSD to military personnel. The purpose of this study is to compare group-administered CPT-Cognitive-only version (CPT-C) to individual CPT-C for the treatment of PTSD in OIF/OEF military personnel. Three hundred (300) adult male and female active-duty OIF/OEF military personnel over 18 years of age will be enrolled into this study.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral ischemia is postulated to be one of the mechanisms of neural injury after ICH. Presumably the hematoma induces ischemia by mechanical compression of the surrounding microvasculature. METHODS: The authors induced ICH in eight anesthetized mongrel dogs by autologous blood injection (7.5 mL) under arterial pressure in the deep white matter adjacent to the left basal ganglia. They measured serial rCBF using radiolabeled microspheres in regions around and distant to the hematoma, as well as cerebral oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption (CMRO2), glucose utilization, and lactate production by serial sampling of cerebral venous blood from the sagittal sinus. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored continuously. All measurements were recorded at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 hours after induction of ICH and compared with prehematoma values. Evans Blue dye was injected at the end of the experiment, and intensity of staining was compared with three control animals. RESULTS: Compared with prehematoma ICP (12.5+/-2.0 mm Hg, mean+/-standard error), significant elevation in ICP was observed after ICH peaking at 5 hours (34.4+/-5.2 mm Hg). Compared with prehematoma MAP (125.8+/-7.0 mm Hg), significant elevation in MAP was observed at 120 minutes after onset of hematoma (139.1+/-4.6 mm Hg), with return to the prehematoma value by 5 hours. There were no significant changes observed in cerebral oxygen extraction (51.4+/-4.3% versus 44.8+/-4.9%) and CMRO2 (1.8+/-0.3 versus 1.64+/-0.2 mL O2/100 g/min) at 5 hours posthematoma (or any other posthematoma measurement) compared with prehematoma values. There were no significant differences observed in rCBF in the perihematoma gray (18.2+/-0.9 mL/100 g/min versus 20.1+/-1.5 mL/100 g/min) or white matter (15.6+/-1.4 mL/100 g/min versus 15.3+/-1.1 mL/100 g/min) at 5 hours posthematoma (or any other posthematoma measurement) compared with prehematoma values. No changes were observed in cerebral glucose utilization, lactate production, and rCBF in other regions after introduction of ICH. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was more prominent in the ipsilateral hemisphere in animals with ICH compared with control animals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a prominent increase in ICP and MAP after ICH, the authors found no evidence to support the presence of an ischemic penumbra in the first 5 hours after ICH. Thus, other mechanisms for acute neural injury and late rCBF changes after ICH must be investigated.',\n",

Observations were based on a sample of 131 high-best-frequency (> 5 kHz), azimuth-sensitive neurons. These were identified by their responses to a set of noise bursts, presented in the free field, that varied in azimuth and sound-pressure level (SPL). Each azimuth-sensitive neuron responded well to some levels at certain azimuths, but did not respond well to any level at other azimuths. 2. Unilateral ear plugging was used to infer each neuron's response to monaural stimulation. Ear plugs, produced by injecting a plastic ear mold compound into the external ear, attenuated sound reaching the tympanic membrane by 25-70 dB. The azimuth tuning of a large proportion of the sample (62/131), referred to as binaural directional (BD), was completely dependent upon binaural stimulation because with one ear plugged, these cells were insensitive to azimuth (either responded well at all azimuths or failed to respond at any azimuth) or in a few cases exhibited striking changes in location of azimuth function peaks. This report describes patterns of monaural responses and binaural interactions exhibited by BD neurons and relates them to each cell's azimuth and level tuning. The response of BD cells to ear plugging is consistent with the hypothesis that they derive azimuth tuning from interaural level differences present in noise bursts. Another component of the sample consisted of monaural directional (27/131) cells that derived azimuth tuning in part or entirely from monaural spectral cues. Cells in the remaining portion of the sample (42/131) responded too unreliably to permit specific conclusions. 3. Binaural interactions were inferred by statistical comparison of a cell's responses to monaural (unilateral plug) and binaural (no plug) stimulation. A larger binaural response than either monaural response was taken as evidence for binaural facilitation. A smaller binaural than monaural response was taken as evidence for binaural inhibition. Binaural facilitation was exhibited by 65% (40/62) of the BD sample (facilitatory cells). Many of these exhibited mixed interactions, i.e., binaural facilitation occurred in response to some azimuth-level combinations, and binaural inhibition to others. Binaural inhibition in the absence of binaural facilitation occurred in 35% (22/62) of the BD sample, a majority of which were EI cells, so called because they received excitatory (E) input from one ear (excitatory ear) and inhibitory (I) input from the other (inhibitory ear). One cell that exhibited binaural inhibition received excitatory input from each ear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\",\n",

Searches for biological markers in depression may have been hindered by assuming that depression is a unitary and relatively homogeneous disorder, mainly of mood, rather than addressing particular, clinically crucial features or diagnostic subtypes. Many studies have implicated quantitative alterations of motility rhythms in depressed human subjects. Since a candidate feature of great public-health significance is the unusually high risk of suicidal behavior in depressive disorders, we studied correlations between a measure (vulnerability index [VI]) derived from multi-scale characteristics of daily-motility rhythms in depressed subjects (n = 36) monitored with noninvasive, wrist-worn, electronic actigraphs and their self-assessed level of suicidal thinking operationalized as a wish to die. Patient-subjects had a stable clinical diagnosis of bipolar-I, bipolar-II, or unipolar major depression (n = 12 of each type). VI was associated inversely with suicidal thinking (r = -0.61 with all subjects and r = -0.73 with bipolar disorder subjects; both p<0.0001) and distinguished patients with bipolar versus unipolar major depression with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 79.2%. VI may be a useful biomarker of characteristic features of major depression, contribute to differentiating bipolar and unipolar depression, and help to detect risk of suicide. An objective biomarker of suicide-risk could be advantageous when patients are unwilling or unable to share suicidal thinking with clinicians.',\n",

Certain features of alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome (AKS) also point to cortical involvement, and this may have a basis in alcohol neurotoxicity.Twenty-five patients with AKS and 24 non-Korsakoff alcoholic controls were compared using an automated CT brain scan program. In addition to evidence of their diencephalic lesions (wide third ventricles), AKS patients revealed widespread cerebral damage with greater Sylvian and interhemispheric fissure (IHF) size than alcoholics. Korsakoffs were also inferior to alcoholics in performance on a category sorting test, in which non-perseverative error scores correlated significantly with IHF size.The principle of distinguishing between selective memory decline and global intellectual decline (GID) was applied to 38 patients with AKS. Indices were developed for each type of deficit and much variation found in their distributions. The degree of GID correlated significantly with IHF size, showing similar trends with other cortical measures.These results suggest a cortical substrate for the degree of GID and a frontal substrate for category sorting deficits; with a probable basis in alcohol neurotoxicity rather than thiamine deficiency, which is not known to impair cortical structure. A new model is proposed of the pathophysiology of alcoholic brain damage and AKS which includes recent work on neurotransmitter sources and thalamo-frontal connections.\",\n",

DESIGN: Two-phase, prospective study. SETTING: University-associated medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. INTERVENTION: In phase I, serum AAG concentrations of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were measured serially and compared with those in 21 controls undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures. In phase II, nimodipine was the pharmacologic probe to determine the relationship between drug distribution into the CNS and changes in AAG concentration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with nimodipine and used to measure total and unbound drug concentrations. Concentrations of AAG were 39% higher in patients than in controls preoperatively. They decreased significantly by 24 hours after surgery in patients and increased in controls. In both groups the concentrations were higher than reported normal values. During the period of reduced AAG concentration, calculated unbound nimodipine concentrations were 3-fold higher (p<0.05) than at later periods, with a trend toward higher total concentrations. Overall, mean CSF nimodipine concentration was 6.4% of mean serum total concentration. The CSF concentrations decreased as AAG concentrations increased, independent of serum concentrations (r = -0.52, p<0.02). CONCLUSION: Concentrations of AAG change after subarachnoid hemorrhage and are transiently influenced by surgery. Unbound drug concentration increases when AAG concentrations decrease, whereas CSF concentrations decrease when AAG concentrations increase. These preliminary findings suggest that changes in AAG concentrations can alter unbound serum nimodipine concentrations and may affect CSF drug distribution.',\n",

The other group underwent no preconditioning before the implantation of the graft (group NP). The follow-up examination was performed by independent observers after 26 months (23-29) in group P and after 25 months (23-30) in group NP (n.s.). At follow-up the KT-1000 laxity test revealed a total side-to-side difference of 2.5 mm (-1.5 to +8.5) in group P and 3.0 mm (-7 to +6.5) in group NP (n.s.).

The purpose of the present study was to ascertain the relationship between serum leptin levels and the lipid profile, insulin resistance, and metabolic risk factors in North Indian adult women. In a transactional case-control study of 390 women, subjects were 186 women with metabolic syndrome according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) guidelines and 204 healthy control women without metabolic syndrome, all of whom were between 20-40 years of age. Circulating leptin levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, insulin resistance was determined by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and the lipid profile was determined using an enzymatic method. Results indicated that circulating leptin (13.38 +/- 9.00 vs. 8.16 +/- 6.31 ng/mL, p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (2.68 +/- 2.05 vs. 1.72 +/- 1.20, p < 0.001), the lipid profile, and other metabolic risk factors (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, and fasting plasma insulin) were significantly higher in women with metabolic syndrome than in women without the syndrome (p < 0.001). Further, in women with metabolic syndrome serum leptin was significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001) and positively correlated with HOMA-IR (p = 0.000) and other metabolic risk factors but negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Circulating leptin was found to be significantly associated with hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and other metabolic risk factors in North Indian adult women.',\n",

A meta-analysis is needed to provide a systematic review of the published findings. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive value of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms on clinical outcome up to October 1, 2010. The quality of each study was scored on the basis of predefined criteria. RESULTS: A total of 13 eligible follow-up studies met all the inclusion criteria. The XRCC1194Trp allele was found to be significantly associated with a favorable response rate relative to 194Arg [Trp vs. Arg: OR, 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.48-2.38]. XRCC1399Gln was less favorably associated with both response rate (Gln vs. Arg: OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) and overall survival (Gln vs. Arg: HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.63) than 399Arg in analyses using all available studies; but these associations became insignificant when only high-quality studies were used. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a predictive role for XRCC1 gene polymorphisms in clinical outcome. However, the role of 399Gln could be considered controversial because its impact on clinical outcome was insignificant in high-quality studies. These findings show the importance of establishing suitable criteria, including genetic epidemiologic, phenotypic, and clinical criteria, to improve quality control of study design and methods in pharmacogenomic studies related to XRCC1 gene polymorphism.',\n",

              "  'PURPOSE: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) are events that alter or seem to alter the neurologic function and, in their appearance, resemble epileptic seizures (ESs). In patients with ESs the psychological and medical aspects of epilepsy greatly influence the health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The relation between these factors and PNESs is not well established. In this study, we compared HRQOL in patients with PNESs with that of patients with ESs. METHODS: We evaluated 105 patients admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit of University Hospital between January 20, 2001, and January 20, 2002. Only patients with the definite diagnosis of ESs or PNESs were analyzed (n = 85). Patients completed an epilepsy-specific quality-of-life instrument (QOLIE-89), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Adverse Events Profile (AEP). We used t tests and regression analyses to contrast HRQOL in PNESs and ESs and to elucidate the main factors associated with HRQOL in patients with PNESs. RESULTS: In our sample, 45 patients had PNESs, and 40 had ESs. The overall HRQOL and scores on 13 of 19 QOLIE-89 subscales were significantly lower (i.e., worse) in PNES than in ES patients. AEP and scores on five of six POMS subscales also were worse in PNES patients than in ES patients. PNES versus ES diagnosis, POMS depression/dejection, and AEP were significant predictors of HRQOL, jointly explaining 65% variation in HRQOL. The lower HRQOL in PNESs versus ESs was in part explained by depression and AEP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNESs have a lower HRQOL and worse mood problems than do patients with ESs. This disadvantage is primarily due to depression and medication side effects, although these factors influence QOL in much the same way in PNES and ES patients. These baseline HRQOL data on patients with PNESs can be used to evaluate the effects of treatment in this patient population.',\n",

The diagnostic and therapeutic attitudes of 94 general practitioners/internists and neurologists/psychiatrists toward demented patients were investigated by questionnaire. This figure represents a return rate of approximately 55% on the questionnaires. As is typical in Germany, no physicians were specializing in geriatric patients, and fewer general practitioners/internists than neurologists/psychiatrists had undergone supplementary psychogeriatric training. A higher percentage of the latter group estimated more than 10% of their elderly patients were demented. Both estimated Alzheimer's disease as less frequent than multi-infarct dementia. Physicians with training in psychogeriatrics claimed to treat more elderly patients than physicians without it. With regard to therapeutic procedure, physicians with psychogeriatric training prescribed nootropics more guardedly. The data from this pilot study suggest that there are no eminent discrepancies between the different medical groups with regard to psychogeriatric care, but there is a great need for supplementary training.\",\n",

              "  \"Polyoxometalates (POMs) are emerging as useful materials for a variety of applications. Many show potential for use in the biological and medical fields. Those incorporating lanthanides, with their narrow emission bands, large Stokes' shift and tuneable emission are of particular interest for the labelling and imaging of biological molecules. Their longer emission timescale (micros to ms) also allows autofluorescence from the biological samples to be removed by time gating the emission decay. This means that the characterisation of their photophysical properties is required to enable their application. In this work we present a time-resolved emission study of two types of POM structure, a simple europium containing decatungstate and a more complex high nuclear polyoxotungstate, containing either europium or terbium. A concentration study, made monitoring the lanthanide emission helped elucidate POM-POM interactions. The use of global analysis hints at the presence of defined POM aggregates. Interaction with serum albumin was ascertained, both by monitoring the lanthanide emission of the POM and the tryptophan emission from the serum albumin. This showed that the more complex structure had a significantly higher affinity for the protein than the simple structure.\",\n",

The enzyme is apparently a dimer of two identical subunits, each containing 1 mol of FAD. Dithionite reduction of the enzyme proceeds in two distinct phases corresponding to approximately 0.5 and 1.1 eq/FAD, respectively. Thiol assays of the NADH oxidase, reduced anaerobically with 1 eq of NADH/FAD prior to denaturation, are consistent with the presence of a single redox-active cysteinyl residue/subunit. Analysis of the cysteinyl peptides of the oxidase, identified in tryptic digests of the enzyme labeled metabolically with [35S]cysteine, reveals a sequence which is closely related to the redox-active cysteinyl peptide sequence recently determined for the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH peroxidase. A second cysteinyl peptide sequence, when aligned with residues 3-17 of the peroxidase NH2-terminal sequence, reveals identity in 7 of 15 positions and satisfies several of the criteria described for ADP-binding structures. Additional probes of the structural and redox properties of the NADH oxidase, including visible circular dichroism spectroscopy and sensitivity to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, provide further evidence for a fundamental structural connection between flavin-dependent NADH oxidase and peroxidase functions.',\n",
